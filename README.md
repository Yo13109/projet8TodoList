# Contribution Document

This document outlines the process for making modifications to the project and the quality assurance procedures that developers should follow. It also includes rules that developers must adhere to when making contributions to the project.

# Process for making modifications
1. Create a fork of the project: Developers should create a fork of the project on their own GitHub account before making any modifications. This allows them to work on their changes independently without affecting the main project.

2. Make the changes: Developers should make the changes they want to contribute to the project in their forked repository.

3. Create a pull request: Once the changes have been made, developers should create a pull request (PR) to merge their changes into the main project. The PR should include a detailed description of the changes made and the reason for the changes.

4. Code review: The code changes in the PR will be reviewed by other members of the development team. They will provide feedback and suggest any necessary changes.

5. Merge changes: Once the code changes have been reviewed and approved, the changes will be merged into the main project.

# Quality assurance procedures
1. To ensure the quality of the project, developers must follow the following procedures when making contributions:

2. Write unit tests: All code changes must be accompanied by unit tests to ensure that the code works as expected and does not introduce any new bugs.

3. Follow coding standards: Developers must adhere to the coding standards set by the project. This includes formatting, naming conventions, and code structure.

4. Test changes: Developers should test their changes thoroughly before submitting a pull request. This includes testing on different environments and with different data sets.

5. Documentation: Any changes made to the project must be documented clearly and thoroughly. This includes updating the project's README file and any relevant documentation.

# Rules for making contributions

2. No breaking changes: Developers must not introduce any breaking changes to the project. Any changes that could potentially break the project must be discussed with the development team before implementation.

3. No code duplication: Developers must not introduce code that duplicates existing code in the project.

4. No malicious code: Developers must not introduce any malicious code or code that could potentially harm the project or its users.

5. No dependencies without approval: Developers must not introduce any new dependencies to the project without approval from the development team.
